## Why we were looking to make changes
While looking into different data that could be shown in Data Hub we realised the data that already existed was quite hidden and hard to find. Some data that users said is useful has low completion rates. Out hypothesis was that the data and fields was too hidden so users didn't fill the information out.

From our understanding of how people use Data Hub, we believed an overview of a company showing key information and status would be useful to users. So we created a design and gathered feedback.

## Design
### Round 1
The design:
* Pulls out key information from the other tabs on the company record
* Provides more information in the Account management section
* Quick links to global actions, ‘add interaction’ and ‘refer this company’
* Shows upcoming activity which was something only possible since syncing Aventri data, which allows us to see when someone registers for an event before it occurs.

#### Outcome of user testing
Feedback was very positive, with only one person saying they wouldn't use this. See the slidedeck in the related links to see more feedback that was received.
* 10 people said it had a clean and simple UI
* 9 people like that it includes a lot of information and is easier to get an overview

> Great to have the company summary on company overview, in particular turnover and employee number as we are cross referencing this quite a lot in our work and it will also prompt us to update it when we speak with clients. Also great to see the HEP status (export potential) as we are asked to populate this so if it is incomplete, this page would prompt us to update it.

> Likes the look and feel - lots of useful info on a page. Good to see essential info on a page.

> An easy way to add companies to lists that we might be creating, at the moment this is hidden under “Options”

> Account management details are clear and can easily see who is responsible.

There were also various suggestions of how to improve the design and other information that would be useful to show. For example:

> Website address of company as that’s  often one of the first things we look at to verify location, sector etc

> When was the last export win - if empty, shows they never had one. All ITAs need to find this when assigned a new client.  Currently hard to find this info.

### Round 2
This design emcompasses a lot of the feedback received. Changes that were made:

#### Header area
* Shows lists the company is added to (this is specific to a user)
* 'Add to list' button
* Company description below name
* Last updated data and source
* 'View options' removed and placed elsewhere on the screen
* Ultimate HQ to show how this would look

#### Business details box added
* Trading and registered addresses, clearly labelled
* Added Companies House and website
* Link to view all business details

#### Account management box
* Shows multiple primary contacts

#### Recent activity
* Swapped recent and upcoming activity boxes
* Added 'add interaction' button to recent activity box

#### Export activity
* Box added based on feedback of low usage (content is specific to a user)
* Added Export Win date to this box as is more related to activity than status.

##### Showing how it looks without data in the fields
The recent activity box with display different messages, e.g. 'No activity recorded' or 'No activity in the last X months'.

> It may be useful if it could automatically state whether a company was : New (no previous ITA interaction), Lapsed (no interaction within the last 12 months), Current (ITA interaction within the last 12 months). This would be useful for me to see at a glance whether I should contact the company without having to keep scrolling down the activity tab.
