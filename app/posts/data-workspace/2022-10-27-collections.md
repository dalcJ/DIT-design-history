## Why we were looking to make changes
From previous research into personalisation and sharing, users had indicated the following:

1. There was an expectation to share data directly from Data Workspace.
2. There was a need for shared spaces.
3. Majority of users use Data Workspace to complete a specific task/set of tasks.
4. Users said they would like to see data that’s relevant to their field or usage. 

The Data Workspace team set out to create an area for users to find the data they use frequently easier, and also give the ability to share this data with others. A high-fidelity prototype was created to test some of the ideas which came out of the previous sessions and see if they added value, helped solve the identified problems, whether the conceptualised journeys and interfaces worked for the user and any other improvements which could be made.

## Changes that were made
A collections section was designed, where a user can group datasets, dashboards and notes. Collections can be used for personal use, a personal collection, or shared between team members, a shared collection.

### 1. The collections homepage
The collections homepage is a place where a user can create a collection. It’s also the area which contains all of the collections that a user has created or is a member of.

### 2. The collections page
A collections page allows users to:
* View, add and remove datasets and dashboards. This gives the user the ability to collate data and dashboards which are relevant to them or their team and group them together in one space.
* Ability to add and edit notes. Allowing users to add additional information to the collection, comment on the work of others and give context to any information held in a collection.
* See who owns the collection  and if it’s a shared collection then other users who have access to the collection are listed.
* The ability to add/remove users to a collection, which can turn a personal collection into a shared collection.
* View the collection history and see changes which have historically been made to the collection.
* The ability to edit the collection and update the name and the description. Also, if the user no longer needs the collection, there’s the ability to delete it.

### 3. Edit collection
Edit collection is an area where the user can edit the name and description of a collection and can also delete a collection.

### 4. Collection History
The collection history is a place where the users within a personal or shared collection can view changes made to the collection. This is especially important on a shared collection as it provides a log of what’s changed, when and who it was changed by. It was suggested by users in the research sessions to have a history that demonstrated if a dataset or dashboard was removed or added, if notes were edited, if a user was removed or added, along with the date and the user who performed this action was logged on that item.

### 5. Add users
The ability to add users can change a personal collection to a shared collection, or add additional users to a shared collection.

## Next steps
Collections is currently live on Data Workspace, so the team is planning on having sessions in the new year to give users time to use collections before gathering feedback. From these sessions, we can gain insight into how people have utilised the collections feature in their work on Data Workspace and also any pain points which may have hindered their experience of collections so far. This is important so we can measure if collections has achieved its goals of:
* Allowing users to share data with other Data Workspace users.
* Improving day to day efficiency by keeping all of their commonly used datasets/visualisations in one area.
* Giving users a more tailored and collaborative experience on Data Workspace.
