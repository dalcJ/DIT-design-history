## Why we were looking to make changes
1. Previous UR had surfaced that many users didn't have awareness of all of the tools and features available in Data Workspace
2. The current navigation doesn't help users find this content or assist them on their journeys (based on Analytics data)
3. There are potential data breach issues with users downloading data and using external platforms to perform tasks.
4. To encourage users to explore Data Workspace

### User problems
In UR conducted in early 2022 it was found that over half of receptive and engaged users who were interviewed had a limited understanding of what Data Workspace was capable of.

It was found that many users don’t navigate or search for features so they don’t learn about how they could better use their data. This also raises issues with users utilising external products to perform tasks available in Data Workspace which heightens the possibility of a data breach.

## Areas explored in user research
### 1. Changes to the homepage design
For the initial round of user research the homepage was redesigned to become more than just a data search.

Changes included:

* Dataset of the week was added to encourage users to explore data
* Bookmarks were surfaced on the homepage to allow easy access to this data
* Features were promoted to the user with links to relevant help centre articles
* 'How to' videos were included on the homepage
* The most popular data from the last 30-days for all users was added

### 2. The effectiveness of the navigation
Analytics data showed the navigation wasn't playing a strong role in assisting users through their journeys on Data Workspace or educating them about what they could do on the platform. In the sessions new users were to be asked about what content they would expect to live under each of the sections.


## Outcomes from the first phase
As a result of initial user research it was clear that the redesigned homepage design wasn’t having the desired effect on users. Most users thought that the content could serve as a distraction away from their daily task and anything that slowed them down in achieving what they had come to Data Workspace to do wasn't useful for them.

Because of this doubts were cast over the dataset of the week, popular data and serving individual tools which might not be relevant to a users need.

> It’s about logging on with my task in mind and trying to, as efficiently as possible, get to the result

> A lot of people would be keen to get to what they want first without interruption and this (dataset of the week) might be an interruption of their train of thought

Based on user behaviour and feedback the homepage was redesigned for the following sessions.

Changes included:

*	Removal of dataset of the week
*	Promote tools as a whole, instead of surfacing specific tools on
	the homepage
*	Add data which the user may be interested in (based on previous usage)
*	Amend the content around the search to explain Data Workspace’s offering
*	Basic card sorting to test a revised navigation (Home, Data, Tools, Dashboards, Support)

## Outcomes from the second phase
The homepage still didn't have the desired effect despite the redesign. It was concluded that trying to educate users and take them away from the task they had come onto Data Workspace to do wasn't an effective way of tackling the problem, and neither was it welcomed by users.

The navigation however did prove to be a useful place to inform users of Data Workspace's offering. The revised navigation provided a much clearer picture to users around what they could do in Data Workspace, while reducing the confusion and lack of clarity that the previous navigation presented. Even when users were asked to browse the content on the new homepage design, their view on what was available in Data Workspace had already been affected by viewing the navigation at the top of the page.

> The homepage seems to cover everything that the menu covers at the top

## Next steps
As a result of the user research it was decided that:

* The concept of a new homepage design should be dropped, there was no value added
* We would start looking at how we can incorporate a ‘Dashboards’ section into the navigation and what this means for the broader user journey
*	Additional changes would be made in the navigation to accommodate learnings from UR sessions, such as removing the ‘About’ and ‘Our work’ sections
*	'Your files' (the ability for users to upload their own data) would be surfaced in the header of Data Workspace
* Research findings would also feed into work looking at personalisation and sharing of analysis, queries and data
