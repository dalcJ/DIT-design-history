## Why we were looking to make changes
1. Users had to manually enter data into Datahub, which was a lengthy process
2. Sometimes manual entry was outsourced, which had cost implications
3. Data was not always entered
4. Data that was entered did not get entered in a consistent format

### User problems
We ran X sessions with users to understand

* It was hard to scan the content
* It was difficult to find specific information from the list of interactions
* There was not enough information to get an overview of an interaction

***
## Changes that were made
### 1. Making the interaction card design consistent across Data Hub
There was inconsistency with the quantity of information displayed and design of the interaction cards, as shown below.

The design has been brought in line with other parts of Data Hub. It is now closer in design to what is used by many other [services across government](https://live-stuff.herokuapp.com/document-types/finder).
