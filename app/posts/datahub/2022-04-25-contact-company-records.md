## Why we were looking to make changes
1. Lots more data was going to be added to the platform, with automatic-sync from other systems. Therefore it was crucial for users to be able to find what they are looking for.
2. The design was inconsistent across the platform.
4. Having different ways to do things on different pages increases the quantity of learning required from users and increases cognitive load.

## Changes that were made
### 1. Making the interaction card design consistent across datahub
See the [post on changes to interaction cards](/datahub/interaction-cards/).

### 2. Making language consistent
#### Using ‘Activity’ instead of 'Interactions'
This is used as a name for a collection of data associated to either a Contact or a Company. The data can include activity that is not direct e.g. information from HMRC about exports. This phrasing was already used on the Company record.
