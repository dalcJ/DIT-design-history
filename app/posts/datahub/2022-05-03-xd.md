## Why we were looking to make changes
1. Lots more data was going to be added to the platform, with automatic-sync from other systems. Therefore it was crucial for users to be able to find what they are looking for.
2. Content was repeated
3. The design was inconsistent across the platform
4. The design didn't follow GDS patterns
5. Users were encountering some problems

### User problems
The User Researcher on the project had heard a number of comments from users whilst conducting research for other parts of Datahub. So, while no specific research was run on this area, we had a good feel for the problems users were facing. This included:

* It was hard to scan the content
* It was difficult to find specific information from the list of interactions
* There was not enough information to get an overview of an interaction

## Changes that were made
### 1. Making the interaction card design consistent across datahub
Previous interaction card on a Contact record:

Previous interaction card on a Company record:

Updated interaction card:

### 2. Making language consistent
#### Using ‘Activity’ instead of 'Interactions'
This is used as a name for a collection of data associated to either a Contact or a Company. The data can include activity that is not direct e.g. information from HMRC about exports. This phrasing was already used on the Company record.
